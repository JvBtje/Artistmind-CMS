# Artistmind-CMS
This is a old version of the artistmind cms system. It is out of use... nobody is using it so I made it public.
- You can have mulitpul themes, but there is only 1 yet
- You can have mulitpul plugins, there are a few
- You can send message to other users
- You have a upload system...
- Database is "defaultdb" Username="Admin" Pas="1234" db is in root dir called "defaultdb.sql"
- Main debuging has been done, so the system is usable. Fine debugging has not been done, but it are not majore problems

Give Jeroen van Beuningen a cup of coffie if you see him somewhere on the streets... I think he needs it...
